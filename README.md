# BankManagementSystem
## OOADJ Project

The Bank Management System (BMS) is a simplified yet effective software solution developed using Spring Boot, Maven, and Thymeleaf to facilitate basic banking operations. Aimed at small to medium-sized banks, the system focuses on withdrawal, deposit, and balance checking transactions for customers.

Customers can access the system by providing their unique customer ID and account number. Once authenticated, they are presented with intuitive options to withdraw funds, deposit money, and check their account balance. The user interface, built with Thymeleaf, ensures a seamless and interactive experience for customers.

Withdrawal transactions allow customers to specify the amount they wish to withdraw from their account. Similarly, deposit transactions enable customers to add funds to their account effortlessly. Account balance checking provides customers with real-time updates on their account balance, enhancing transparency and trust.

Behind the scenes, Spring Boot powers the application with its robust and convention-over-configuration approach, simplifying development and deployment tasks. Maven manages project dependencies and facilitates project build processes, ensuring smooth development workflows.

In conclusion, the Bank Management System built with Spring Boot, Maven, and Thymeleaf offers a straightforward yet reliable solution for banks.
